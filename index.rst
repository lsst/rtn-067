On JIRA workflows for ovservatory operations

Abstract

.. abstract::

   Rubin has extensive and in some cases sophisticated workflows based on JIRA for anything from managing planned work, to reporting bugs,  to defining validation campaigns,  to managing staff travel. There are 12 highly active JIRA projects supporting this diverse collection of workflows and they are central to the working day of project staff. 

With nightly telescope operations becoming a central focus, the question arises of how and to what extent to integrate night-time operations to the well developed workflows staff are already using. This document discusses some of the issues raised and proposes a workflow as a basis of further discussion.
